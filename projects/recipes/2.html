<h1>Candy Chestnuts</h1>
     <p>My family does not have long history with Chestnuts, unlike gumbo, but
    it is still important to my family today. My backyard has two trees that 
    produse about 200 lb each year. One of the recipes we found was this one.</p>
     <ul>
	     <li>2 cups chestnuts</li>
	     <li>1 ½ cup water</li>
	     <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
	     <li>1½ tablespoons butter</li>
	     <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
	     <li>⅓ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Instuctions</h2>
     <ol>
	     <li>Add the water, brown sugar, butter, salt, and cinnamon to a 
pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
	     <li>Add the chestnuts and stir gently to coat them with the syrup, being careful not to break apart the nuts. Let the mixture boil uncovered until most of the liquid is reduced.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Done</p>
